# C-Sorting-Mini-project

I created a mini project in C that implements various sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort. The project showcases the use of different sorting techniques, applying both brute force and divide-and-conquer strategies to sort arrays efficiently. This demonstrates a comparison of the performance and effectiveness of each sorting method in different scenarios.
